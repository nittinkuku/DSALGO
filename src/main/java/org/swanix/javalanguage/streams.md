# Streams
Streams are an update to the java API that lets you manipulate collections of data in a declarative way. You can think of them as fancy iterators over a collection of data.

##### Streams Definition
    A sequence of elements from a source that supports data processing operations.
    
    Sequence of elements : A stream is a sequence of elements from a source
    Source               : Streams consume from a data-providing source such as collections, arrays, or I/O resources. 
                           Generating a stream from an ordered collection preserves the ordering.
    Data processing ops  : Streams support database like operations and common operations from functional programming languages to manipulate data such as filter, map, reduce, find, match, sort and so on.  
                           Stream operations can be executed either sequentially or in parallel.  
        
        
    Important characteristics of streams operations:
       Pipelining        : Many Stream operations return a stream allowing operations to be chained and form a larger pipeline.
       Interal Iteration : In contrast to collections, stream operations do the iteration behind the scenes implicitely. 
       
    similarly to iterators, a stream can be traversed only once. After that a stream is said to be consumed.       
        
##### Streams vs Collection
    - Collections are about data while Streams are about computations. 
    - collections are data structures, they are mostly about storing and accessing elements with specific time/space complexities.
    - Streams are about expressing computations such as filter, sorted and map. 
    
##### Intermediate vs Terminal
    Intermediate : Stream operations that returns a strean and can be connected are called intermediate operations. 
                   These don't perform any processing until a terminal operation is invoked on the stream pipeline-they're lazy.
    Terminal     : Operations that closes a stream are called terminal operations. 
    
#### Stream Operations

##### Filter
    This operation takes as argument a predicate and returns a stream including all elements that match the predicate (elements for which predicate returns true)

    Operation           :   filter        
    Type                :   Intermediate              
    Return Type         :   Stream<T>             
    args                :   Predicate<T>  
    Function descriptor :   T -> boolean
    
    e.g.     List<Dish> vegetarian = menu.stream()
                                      .filter(Dish::isVegetarian)
                                      .collect(toList());

##### Distinct
    This returns a stream with unique elements (according to the implementation of the hashCode and equals methods of the objects produced by the stream).
    
    Operation   :   distinct        
    Type        :   Intermediate (stateful-unbounded)              
    Return Type :   Stream<T>
    
    e.g.      List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 2, 4);
              numbers.stream()
             .filter(i -> i % 2 == 0)
             .distinct()
             .forEach(System.out::println);

##### Limit
    This returns a stream that's no longer than a given size.
    
    Operation   :   limit        
    Type        :   Intermediate (stateful-bounded)	              
    Return Type :   Stream<T>             
    args        :   long  
    
    e.g.      List<Dish> dishes = menu.stream()
                                        .filter(d -> d.getCalories() > 300)
                                        .limit(3)
                                        .collect(toList());

##### Skip
    This a stream that discards the first n elements. If the stream has fewer elements than n, then an empty stream is returned
    
    Operation   :   skip        
    Type        :   Intermediate (stateful-bounded)	              
    Return Type :   Stream<T>             
    args        :   long   
    
    e.g.       List<Dish> dishes = menu.stream()
                                       .filter(d -> d.getCalories() > 300)
                                       .skip(2)
                                       .collect(toList());

##### Map
    The method map takes a function as argument. The function is applied to each element, mapping it into a new element
    
    Operation           :   map        
    Type                :   Intermediate              
    Return Type         :   Stream<R>             
    args                :   Function<T, R>  
    Function descriptor :   T -> R  
    
    e.g.        List<String> dishNames = menu.stream()                             
                                             .map(Dish::getName)                             
                                             .collect(toList());
    
##### Flat Map   
    In a nutshell, the flatMap method lets you replace each value of a stream with another stream and then concatenates all the generated streams into a single stream. 
    
    Operation           :   flatMap        
    Type                :   Intermediate              
    Return Type         :   Stream<R>             
    args                :   Function<T, Stream<R>>  
    Function descriptor :   T -> Stream<R> 
    
    eg.         List<String> uniqueCharacters = words.stream()
                                                     .map(w->w.split(""))
                                                     .flatMap(Arrays::stream)
                                                     .distinct()
                                                     .collect(Collectors.toList());
                                                     
##### Any Match   
    The anyMatch method can be used to answer the question â€œIs there an element in the stream matching the given predicate?" 
    
    Operation           :   anyMatch        
    Type                :   Terminal              
    Return Type         :   boolean            
    args                :   Predicate<T>  
    Function descriptor :   T -> boolean  
    
    eg.         boolean isThereAnyVegetarianDish = menu.stream()
                                                       .anyMatch(Dish::isVegetarian);

##### All Match   
    The allMatch method works similarly to anyMatch but will check to see if all the elements of the stream match the given predicate.  
    
    Operation           :   allMatch        
    Type                :   Terminal              
    Return Type         :   boolean            
    args                :   Predicate<T>  
    Function descriptor :   T -> boolean 
    
    eg.         boolean isHealthy = menu.stream()
                                        .allMatch(d -> d.getCalories() < 1000);
                                        
##### None Match   
    The opposite of allMatch is noneMatch. It ensures that no elements in the stream match the given predicate.  
     
    Operation           :   noneMatch        
    Type                :   Terminal              
    Return Type         :   boolean            
    args                :   Predicate<T>  
    Function descriptor :   T -> boolean 
     
    eg.         boolean isHealthy = menu.stream()                        
                                         .noneMatch(d -> d.getCalories() >= 1000);   
                                         
##### Find Any   
    The findAny method returns an arbitrary element of the current stream.  
     
    Operation   :   findAny        
    Type        :   Terminal              
    Return Type :   Optional<T>
     
    eg.         Optional<Dish> dish =  menu.stream()      
                                            .filter(Dish::isVegetarian)      
                                            .findAny(); 

##### Find First   
    The findFirst method returns the first element in the stream.  
     
    Operation   :   findFirst        
    Type        :   Terminal              
    Return Type :   Optional<T> 
     
    eg.        Optional<Integer> firstSquareDivisibleByThree =  someNumbers.stream()             
                                                                            .map(x -> x * x)             
                                                                            .filter(x -> x % 3 == 0)             
                                                                            .findFirst();

##### Reduce   
    The reduce method is used to reduce the stream to a single element by combinging all elements. 
     
    Operation           :   reduce        
    Type                :   Terminal (stateful-bounded)              
    Return Type         :   Optional<T>            
    args                :   BinaryOperator<T>  
    Function descriptor :   (T, T) -> T  
     
    eg.        int sum = numbers.stream()
                                 .reduce(0, (a, b) -> a + b);
                                 
     In Java 8 the Integer class now comes with a static sum method to add two numbers    
                
                int sum = numbers.stream().reduce(0, Integer::sum);     
                                        
     No Initial Value :
     
                Optional<Integer> sum = numbers.stream()
                                               .reduce((a, b) -> (a + b));
     

##### Max and Min
    Max and Min value of a stream can be deduced using reduce method.  
     
    Operation           :   reduce        
    Type                :   Terminal (stateful-bounded)              
    Return Type         :   Optional<T>            
    args                :   BinaryOperator<T>  
    Function descriptor :   (T, T) -> T
     
    eg.        Optional<Integer> max = numbers.stream()
                                                .reduce(Integer::max);
                                 
                Optional<Integer> min = numbers.stream()
                                                .reduce(Integer::min);
                                                
##### Count
    The count method gives the no of elements in the Stream.  
     
    Operation           :   count        
    Type                :   Terminal           
    Return Type         :   long           
     
    eg.        long noOfElements = numbers.stream()
                                           .count;      
                                                                                                                                  
##### Sorted
    The sorted method ...  
     
    Operation           :   sorted        
    Type                :   Intermediate (stateful-unbounded)              
    Return Type         :   Stream<T>            
    args                :   Comparator<T>  
    Function descriptor :   (T, T) -> int         
     
    eg.        

##### ForEach
    The forEach method ...  
     
    Operation           :   forEach        
    Type                :   Terminal              
    Return Type         :   void            
    args                :   Consumer<T>  
    Function descriptor :   T -> void         
     
    eg.        
                                                            
##### Collect
     The collect method ....
     
    Operation           :   collect        
    Type                :   Terminal              
    Return Type         :   R            
    args                :   Collector<T, A, R>            
     
    eg.                                                      

#### Primitive Stream
There are primitive streams to avoid autoboxing and to provide some specialized functions.

##### Converting General Stream to Primitive Stream
    int calories = menu.stream()
                       .mapToInt(Dish::getCalories) // converts to IntStream
                       .sum();
                       
##### Converting Primitive Stream to General Stream
    IntStream intStream = menu.stream().mapToInt(Dish::getCalories):
    Stream<Integer> stream1 = intStream.boxed();
    Stream<Integer> stream2 = intStream.mapToObj(Integer::new);   
    
##### Sum,Max
    int totalCalories = menu.stream()
                            .mapToInt(Dish::getCalories)
                            .sum();
    OptionalInt maxCalories = menu.stream()
                                  .mapToInt(Dish::getCalories)
                                  .max();

##### Numeric ranges (IntStream and LongStream)
    Java has two static methods available on IntStream and LongStream to help generate range of numbers:
    range       : range is exclusive 
                IntStream numbers = IntStream.range(1,5)      // generate numbers from 1 to 4
                
    rangeClosed : rangeClosed is inclusive
                IntStream numbers = IntStream.rangeClosed(1,5)    // generate numbers from 1 to 5
   
#### Building Streams
    Empty Stream :
                Stream<String> emptyStream = Stream.empty();
    From explicit values : 
            Stream<String> stream = Stream.of("Java 8 ", "Lambdas ", "In ", "Action");
    From arrays :
            int[] numbers = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}; 
            Arrays.stream(numbers)
    From Files :
            try(Stream<String> lines = Files.lines(Paths.get("data.txt"), Charset.defaultCharset()))
            Files.lines returns a Stream of Lines as Strings from a given file. 

#### Infinite Streams
    iterate and generate methods allows you to create infinite stream: a stream which does not have a fixed size.
    
    Iterate :   The iterate method takes an initial value and a lambda of type Unary Operator<T> to apply  successively on each new value.
                In general you should use iterate when you need to produce a sequence of successive values, like a date followed by its next date.
                
                Stream.iterate(0, n->n+2) // initial value(0), unary operator(T)
                      .limit(10)
                      .forEach(System.out::println);
    
    Generate:   Similar to iterate generate method lets you produce an infinite stream of values. It takes a lambda of type Supplier<T> to provide new values.
                
                Stream.generate(Math::random)
                      .limit(5)
                      .forEach(System.out::println);

#### Collecting Data with stream
##### Reducing & Summarizing
##### ToList,ToSet & ToCollection
    toList : Gather all the streamâ€™s items in a List.                                       
             List<Dish> dishes = menuStream.collect(toList());
                                                    
    toSet :  Gather all the streamâ€™s items in a Set, eliminating duplicates.                                       
            Set<Dish> dishes = menuStream.collect(toSet());   
                                                
    toCollection : Gather all the streamâ€™s items in the collection created by the provided supplier.
            Set<Dish> dishes = menuStream.collect(toCollection(HashSet::new));
            
##### Counting
    Use the collector returned by the counting factory method
    
    long howManyDishes = menu.stream()
                             .collect(Collectors.counting());
    Easy Way :
                long howManyDishes = menu.stream().count();   
                
##### Max and Min
    We can use two collectors Collectors.maxBy() and Collectors.minBy() to calculate the max and min value in a stream
    
    Optional<Dish> mostCalorieDish =  menu.stream()
                                          .collect(Collectors.maxBy(Comparator.comparingInt(Dish::getCalories)));
    Optional<Dish> leastCalorieDish =  menu.stream()
                                              .collect(Collectors.minBy(Comparator.comparingInt(Dish::getCalories)));                       

##### Sum,Avg and Statistics
    Collectors class provides a specific factory method for summing. Collectors.summingInt that accepts a function 
    that converts an object to int that has to be summed. 
    
    Sum :
    int totalCalories = menu.stream().collect(Collectors.summingInt(Dish::getCalories));
    
    There is also a method called summingDouble which behave exactly the same way
    
    Avg :
    int avgCalories = menu.stream().collect(Collectors.averageInt(Dish::getCalories));
    
    Statistics :
    IntSummaryStatistics menuStatistics = menu.stream()
                                              .collect(Collectors.summarizingInt(Dish::Calories));
                                              
    IntSummaryStatistics{count=9, sum=4300, min=120, average=477.256, max=800};
    
    There are corresponding summarizingLong and summarizingDouble methods with associated types for LongSummaryStatistics and DoubleSummaryStatistics

##### Joining Strings
    The collector returned by the joining factory method concatenates into a single string all strings resulting from invoking the toString method on each object.

    String shortMenu = menu.stream()
                           .map(Dish::getName)
                           .collect(Collectors.joining());
    Delimiter
    String shortMenu = menu.stream()
                               .map(Dish::getName)
                               .collect(Collectors.joining(","));
                            
##### Reduction
    int totalCalories = menu.stream()
                            .collect(Collectors.reducing(0,Dish::getCalories,(i,j)->i+j));
    Simplified
    int totalCalories = menu.stream()
                            .collect(Collectors.reducing(0,Dish::getCalories,Integer::sum));
    
    It takes three arguments
    1) Starting Value : This will also be the value returned in the case of empty stream
    2) Function<T,R>  : Mapping function which provides the value for reduction
    3) Binary Operator: That aggregators two items to a single

    Collector with one argument can be think of as a particular case of three-argument constructor, which used the first item as a starting point
    and an identity function as a transformation function
    
    Option<Dish> mostCalorieDish = menu.stream()
                                       .collect(Collectors.reducing((d1,d2)->d1.getCalories()>d2.getCalories() ? d1:d2));
    
##### Grouping elements
##### Simple Grouping :   
    The result of this grouping operation is a Map having a key the value returned by the classification function and 
    as corresponding map value a list of all the items in the stream having that classified value.
    
    Map<Dish.Type,List<Dish>> dishesByType = menu.stream()
                                                 .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(Dish::getType));
    
##### Multilevel Grouping : 
    Collectors.groupingBy factory method has a two-argument version which accepts a second argument of type collector besides the usual classification function
        
    Map<Dish.Type, Map<String, List<Dish>> dishesByCaloricLevel = menu.stream()
                    .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(Dish::getType, Collectors.groupingBy(Dish::getOrigin)));
    
    one-argument groupingBy(f) where f is the classification function, is in reality just shorthand for groupingBy(f,toList())     
    
##### CollectingAndThen :
    The method takes two arguments, the collector to be adapted and a transformation function and then returns another collector
    
    Map<Dish.Type, Optional<Dish>> mostCaloricByType = menu.stream()
                .collect(groupingBy(Dish::getType, maxBy(comparingInt(Dish::getCalories))));      
                                  
    //using the maxBy collector to find the highest calorie dish but this is not very useful as it gives Optional<Dish>
    
    Map<Dish.Type, Dish> mostCaloricDishByType = menu.stream()
                                                     .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(Dish::getType, 
                                                     Collectors.collectingAndThen(maxBy(Comparator.comparingInt(Dish::getCalories)),Optional::get)));   
                                                     
    This factory method takes two arguments, the collector to be adapted and a transformation function, and returns another collector. 
    This additional collector acts as a wrapper for the old one and maps the value it returns using the transformation function as the last step of the collect operation.                                                                
    
    More generally, the collector passes as second argument to the groupingBy factory method will be used to perform a further reduction operation on all the elements in the stream classified into the same group
    
    More examples :
                Map<Dish.Type, Integer> totalCaloriesByType = menu.stream()
                                                                  .collect(groupingBy(Dish::getType,summingInt(Dish::getCalories)));
                                                                  
    mapping function:
                
                Map<Dish.Type, Set<CaloricLevel>> caloricLevelsByType =menu.stream()
                                        .collect(groupingBy(Dish::getType, 
                                        Collectors.mapping(
                                        dish -> { if (dish.getCalories() <= 400) return CaloricLevel.DIET;
                                                  else if (dish.getCalories() <= 700) return CaloricLevel.NORMAL;
                                                  else return CaloricLevel.FAT; },    
                                        toSet())));
                                        
    //This method takes two arguments: a function transforming the elements in a stream and a further collector accumulating the objects resulting from this transformation.
    
    Map<Dish.Type, Set<CaloricLevel>> caloricLevelsByType =menu.stream()
                                                               .collect(groupingBy(Dish::getType, 
                                                               Collectors.mapping(    
                                                               dish -> { if (dish.getCalories() <= 400) return CaloricLevel.DIET;            
                                                                         else if (dish.getCalories() <= 700) return CaloricLevel.NORMAL;          
                                                                         else return CaloricLevel.FAT; },    
                                                               toCollection(HashSet::new) )));
                                                               
    In the previous example there is no guarantee what kind of set will be returned.                                                               
    
##### Partitioning
    Partitioning is a special case of grouping: having a predicate (a function returning a boolean), called a partitioning function, as a classification function. 
    The fact that the partitioning function returns a boolean means the resulting grouping Map will have a Boolean as a key type and therefore there can be at most two different groupsâ€”one for true and one for false. 
    It has the advantage of keeping both lists of the stream elements, for which the application of partitioning function returns true or false.
    
    Map<Boolean, List<Dish>> partitionedMenu = menu.stream()
                                                   .collect(partitioningBy(Dish::isVegetarian));
                 List<Dish> vegetarianDishes = partitionedMenu.get(true);

    It has an overloaded version to which we can pass a second collector.
    
    Map<Boolean, Map<Dish.Type, List<Dish>>> vegetarianDishesByType = menu.stream.collect(
                                                                            partitioningBy(Dish::isVegetarian,
                                                                                groupingBy(Dish::getType)));
                                           
    Another example :
    
    Map<Boolean, Dish> mostCaloricPartitionedByVegetarian = menu.stream.collect(
                                                                    partitioningBy(Dish::isVegetarian,
                                                                        collectingAndThen(
                                                                            maxBy(comparingint(Dish::getCalories)),
                                                                            Optional::get)));                                           
                                                                            
##### Custom Collector                                                       
    The Collector interface consists of a set of methods that provide a blueprint for how to implement specific reduction operations (that is, collectors)
    
    public interface Collector<T, A, R> {    
            Supplier<A> supplier();    
            BiConsumer<A, T> accumulator();    
            Function<A, R> finisher();    
            BinaryOperator<A> combiner();    
            Set<Characteristics> characteristics();
    }
    
    T is the generic type of the items in the stream to be collected.                                       
    A is the type of the accumulator, the object on which the partial result will be accumulated during the collection process.                                       
    R is the type of the object (typically, but not always, the collection) resulting from the collect operation.      
    
    1.  The supplier method has to return a Supplier of an empty resultâ€”a parameterless function that when invoked creates an instance of an empty accumulator used during the collection process
    
            public Supplier<List<T>> supplier() {    
                //return () -> new ArrayList<T>();
                  return ArrayList::new;
            }                                 
    
    2.  The accumulator method returns the function that performs the reduction operation. When traversing the nth element in the stream, this function is applied with two arguments, 
        the accumulator being the result of the reduction (after having collected the first nâ€“1 items of the stream) and the nth element itself.
    
            public BiConsumer<List<T>, T> accumulator() {
                //return (list, item) -> list.add(item);    
                return List::add;
            }
    
    3.  The finisher method has to return a function thatâ€™s invoked at the end of the accumulation process, 
        after having completely traversed the stream, in order to transform the accumulator object into the final result of the whole collection operation.
    
            public Function<List<T>, List<T>> finisher() {    
                return Function.identity();
            }
    
    4.  The combiner method return a function used by the reduction operation, defines how the accumulators resulting from the reduction of different subparts of the stream are combined when the subparts are processed in parallel.
    
            public BinaryOperator<List<T>> combiner() {   
                return (list1, list2) -> {        
                    list1.addAll(list2);        
                    return list1; 
                }
            }
    
    5.  The last method, characteristics, returns an immutable set of Characteristics, defining the behavior of the collectorâ€”in particular providing hints about 
        whether the stream can be reduced in parallel and which optimizations are valid when doing so.
    
        UNORDERED       :   The result of the reduction isnâ€™t affected by the order in which the items in the stream are traversed and accumulated.                                       
        CONCURRENT      :   The accumulator function can be called concurrently from multiple threads, and then this collector can perform a parallel reduction of the stream. 
                            If the collector isnâ€™t also flagged as UNORDERED, it can perform a parallel reduction only when itâ€™s applied to an unordered data source.                                       
        IDENTITY_FINISH :  This indicates the function returned by the finisher method is the identity one, and its application can be omitted. 
                           In this case, the accumulator object is directly used as the final result of the reduction process.
        
        public Set<Characteristics> characteristics(){
            return Collections.unmodifiableList(EnumSet.of(
                        IDENTITY_FINISH,CONCURRENT));
        }
        
        In the case of an IDENTITY_FINISH collection operation, Stream has an overloaded collect method accepting the three other functionsâ€”supplier, accumulator, and combiner.
        
            List<Dish> dishesList =  menuStream().collect(
                                                 ArrayList::new,
                                                 List::add,
                                                 List::addAll);
                                                 
### Parallel Streams    
         Making a stream parallel is as simple as calling parallel() on a stream.
        
        e.g.  Stream.iterator(1,i->i+1)
                    .limit(n)
                    .parallel()
                    .reduce(0,Long::sum);    
            
    Calling the method parallel on a sequential stream doesnâ€™t imply any concrete transformation on the stream itself. 
    Internally, a boolean flag is set to signal that you want to run in parallel all the operations that follow the invocation to parallel. 
    Similarly, you can turn a parallel stream into a sequential one by just invoking the method sequential on it.                                             

    the last call to parallel or sequential wins and affects the pipeline globally
